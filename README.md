# Fundamental Algorithms

There are some algorithms so ubiquitous in computer science that you cannot consider yourself a serious programmer if you are not at least familiar with them. In this case, it is better to have actually implemented these algorithms than to have simply read about them. This project endeavours to fill the gaps within any computer science education by implementing these algorithms from scratch in python. Effort will be given to explain, compartmentalize, and test these algorithms but, above all, they must work.

## Background

Many algorithms will be studied including graph searches, list sorts, optimization algorithms, image processing systems, etc. You will find each project under the `projects/` folder where they will be treated as their own projects in and of themselves. The git repo has been initialized around the parent folder to keep these small projects contained in one convenient space.


## Usage

See instructions within each project for more details.
